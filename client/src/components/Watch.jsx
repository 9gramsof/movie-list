// import React from 'react';

//data for watched movies

//a function that toggles watch status,
  //would take in a title and a cb as parameters
  //if title in watched movies
    //delete title from watched movies
    //cb(false) -> so the movie title does not render
  //if title not in watched movies
    //add title to watched movies
    //cb(true) -> so the movie title renders

//this toggle function would be used with onClick event listener and pass a render function as a callback


// export default Watch;
